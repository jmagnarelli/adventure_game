Welcome to Prism, a simple adventure game written in Prolog. 
First run the 'start' rule, then move about with the 'move(<direction>)' rule, 
where direction is one of n, s, e, w, u, or d.  Movement is allowed in six directions in Prism. 
You can examine just about anything in the game with the 'examine(<item>)' rule, and you can pick 
up items with the 'take(<item>)' rule.  Your inventory can be printed with the 'i' rule or the 
'inventory' rule.  You can use items with the 'use(<item>)' rule, and can use an item that you 
are carrying with another item via the 'use(<item1>, <item2>)' rule, so long as the inventory item 
is given as the first parameter.  The use rule also allows you to talk to characters in the game. 
You can look about with the 'look' rule.  Have fun.



You are standing in a perfectly cubic room, about 15 feet to a side.  Its walls are 
translucent, white panels.  There is a hatch in the center of each wall, the 
ceiling, and the floor.  There is a series of rungs set into the 
middle of  each wall, the ceiling, and the floor.
There is a book_of_matches in the room.
