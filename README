This is a simple adventure game written in Prolog.  
It was developed as a solution to the project 1 of the 
"Foundations of Artificial Intelligence" course taught at CCIS, 
Northeastern University.

I hope that you enjoy it.

I will not be using any late days on this assignment.

If there are any doubts about which features I was implementing with any particular game feature, please contact me.  I believe that I've implemented over 100 points worth of such features.
